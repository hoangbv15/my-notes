# ACS Override vulnerability

Using the ACS override patch to put two non-physically-separated devices into one IOMMU group completely compromises system security. Attaching one of those devices (but not the other) to a VM would allow malicious software running in the VM to issue writes to the other device (the one attached to the host!). This is a VM escape.

Imagine you use the ACS Override patch to attach your graphics card to a VM for some gaming. A virus infects the VM. It proceeds to use the motherboard sound card which was in the same IOMMU group as your graphics card to break out of the VM (by writing host kernel memory) and take over the host OS.

The ACS Override patch is **never**, **ever**, **ever** going to be part of the Linux kernel. Also, if you are using it, I strongly encourage you to stop and find hardware that is properly isolated. While you are using it to attach part-but-not-all of an IOMMU group to guest, your system is neither secure nor reliable. An accidental write by the guest to the wrong address could overwrite any memory on your host.
